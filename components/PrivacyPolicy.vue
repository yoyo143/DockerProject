                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                    <li><u>Third-Party Services.</u> Third-Party Services may use their own Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit personal information from you. For example, BNED maintains its own branded pages on various social networks. When you visit these BNED-branded social media pages, the provider of the social network and other Third-Party Services may set Tracking Technologies on your browser or device.</li>
                    <li><u>Social Features.</u> Certain functionalities on the Services may permit interactions that you initiate between the Services and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Services and a Third-Party Services; "liking" or "sharing" BNED content; logging in to the Services using your Third-Party Services account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Services); and to otherwise connect the Services to a Third-Party Services (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Services). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Services (see "Information You Disclose Publicly or to Others" section above) or by the Third-Party Services that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with BNED or its affiliates in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Services or otherwise by BNED and its affiliates. Also, both BNED and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Services and any Third-Party Services.</li>
                    <li><u>Advertising.</u> We may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing, across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device usage, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). Our advertisers' and ad networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
                    <li><u>Your Tracking Technologies Choices.</u>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
                            <li>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe's website http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</li>
                            <li>Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.</li>
                            <li>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutdnt.com </a>, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information. You have the right to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to "do not track" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the "How to Contact Us" section below.</li>
                            <li>Many advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. You can also go to <a href="http://www.adroll.com/about/privacy" target="_blank">http://www.adroll.com/about/privacy</a> to adjust your advertising preferences with our provider AdRoll.</li>
                            <li>Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.</li>
                            <li>We support the ad industry's 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<a href="https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>) and expect that ad networks that we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</li>
                            <li>In addition, we may serve ads on third-party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our databases ("Matched List Ads"). This is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services. We are not responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. We are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may change their options without notice to us or you.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><u>Analytics.</u> We may use Third-Party Services such as Google Analytics and Sailthru to help us analyze our performance and our delivery of services and advertising to you. For example, we may use Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.
